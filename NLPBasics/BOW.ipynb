       " 'Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.',\n",
       " 'Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.',\n",

       " 'transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.',\n",
       " '[6]\\nIn the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[7][8] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,[9] parsing,[10][11] and many others.',\n",

       " 'More recent systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules: \\nDespite the popularity of machine learning in NLP research, symbolic methods are still (2020) commonly used:\\nSince the so-called \"statistical revolution\"[15][16] in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning.',\n",

       " 'Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing).',\n",
